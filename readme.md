# Car Price Prediction

This project predicts car prices using a Random Forest Regressor. The process involves exploratory data analysis and cleaning of features before training the model. The model achieves an accuracy of 96.75%.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Collection**:
   - A dataset of car features and prices is used as the starting point.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Detailed analysis of the data to understand the distribution and relationships between features.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Cleaning the features to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creating new features and selecting important ones for better prediction accuracy.

5. **Model Training**:
   - Using RandomForestRegressor to train the model on the cleaned data.
